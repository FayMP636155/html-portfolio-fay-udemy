<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m Fay Mae Palaña, an inquisitive and analytical thinker with an INTP personality — which means I’m naturally curious, enjoy solving complex problems, and love exploring how things work. I’m also a proud cat person, and I often find myself inspired (and occasionally interrupted) by my feline friends while tinkering with projects or learning something new.</p>

<p>My professional journey has taken me across different roles and countries, giving me unique experiences and perspectives along the way. I’m currently a Student Developer at Uplift Bootcamp, where I build and implement web application features using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. Before this, I worked as a Call Center Agent at Teleperformance in Quezon City, assisting customers with empathy and professionalism. That experience strengthened my communication and problem-solving skills in fast-paced, team-oriented environments, and taught me how to monitor and improve service quality.</p>

<p>I’ve also had the chance to work in Australia, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil across roles such as clothing manufacturing staff, receptionist and bar attendant volunteer, and cashier & fuel attendant. These diverse positions helped me develop strong operational execution and customer service capabilities — all of which are surprisingly useful when thinking about business processes in technical contexts. Living and working internationally also expanded my linguistic abilities: I’m fluent in English, Tagalog, and Portuguese, and I speak Spanish at a B1 level.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about technology and systems thinking, and my goal is to grow into a DevOps role — or whatever that discipline evolves into in the future — where I can combine automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement to help teams build better software faster.</p>

<p>When I’m not working or learning something new, you can find me exploring new hobbies, reading up on tech trends, and hanging out with my daughter and cats.</p>
